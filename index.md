## Part 1

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?**

* **Computer**: Asus ROG
* **Operating System**: Windows
* **Web Browser**: Google Chrome
* **Code Editor**: VScode

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying "it doesn't work".**
